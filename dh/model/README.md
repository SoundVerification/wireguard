## Files

- The `dh.spthy` file contains the Tamarin model, including the security properties and the auxiliary lemmas.


## Prerequisite

To verify our model of DH, you need **Tamarin**
which can be obtained from [its website](https://tamarin-prover.github.io).
Version 1.6.0 is known to work.

**Python2** is also required to run the oracle.



## Instructions

To verify the model with Tamarin, use the following command:

`tamarin-prover --prove dh.spthy`


## Verification with Docker
The model together with Tamarin and its dependencies are provided as a Docker image.
The image can be pulled and the Tamarin model can be verified as follows (assuming that Docker has been installed):
```
docker run -it ghcr.io/soundverification/tamarin:latest tamarin-prover --prove dh.spthy
```
