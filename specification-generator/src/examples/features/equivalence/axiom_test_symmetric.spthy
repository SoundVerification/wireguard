The Equality Rule should find these two systems NOT equivalent, due to
the fact that on the right-hand side the rule is applicable, while on
the left the rule cannot be used at all. Without the restriction it does
find a different attack, as on the left the two outputs can be
compared and are equal, which does not hold on the right.
