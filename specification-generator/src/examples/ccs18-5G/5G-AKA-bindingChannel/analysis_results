## WITH A BINDING CHANNEL SN-HN

Note that injective agreement on constant terms is always violated.

Agreement of UE with SEAF before KC:
	- weakagreement_ue_seaf_noRev fails
	- => N.I. and I. on K_seaf, SUPI, and SNname fail as well
	- REASON: Trivially, as SEAF does not yet make the Running-claim at this point

Agreement of UE with SEAF after KC:

  = Kseaf:
	- injectiveagreement_ue_seaf_kseaf_keyConf_noKeyRev_noChanRev is satisfied.
	- => noninjectiveagreement_ue_seaf_kseaf_keyConf_noKeyRev_noChanRev is satisfied.
	- (non)injectiveagreement_ue_seaf_kseaf_keyConf_noAsyKeyRev_noSupiRev_noSqnRev_noChanRev are violated because of attack on weakagreement.
	- (non)injectiveagreement_ue_seaf_kseaf_keyConf_noAsyKeyRev_noSupiRev_noSqnRev_noKeyRev are violated because of attack on weakagreement.

  = SUPI:
	- injective agreement fails trivially (supi is constant)
	- non-injective agreement is the same as weak agreement.

  = SNname:
	- injective agreement fails trivially (SNID is constant)
	- non-injective agreement is the same as weak agreement.

  = W-A:
	- weakagreement_ue_seaf_keyConf_noAsyKeyRev_noSupiRev_noSqnRev_noChanRev is violated.
	- weakagreement_ue_seaf_keyConf_noAsyKeyRev_noSupiRev_noSqnRev_noKeyRev is violated.
	- weakagreement_ue_seaf_keyConf_noKeyRev_noChanRev is satisfied because of satisfaction of injective agreement.

  => minimal assumption is not(K) AND key-conf AND channel secure (AND binding channel)


Agreement of SEAF with UE before KC:

  = Kseaf:
	- injectiveagreement_seaf_ue_kseaf_noKeyRev_noChanRev is satisfied.
	- => noninjectiveagreement_seaf_ue_kseaf_noKeyRev_noChanRev is satisfied.
	- (non)injectiveagreement_seaf_ue_kseaf_noKeyRev_noAsyKeyRev_noSupiRev_noSqnRev are vioated because of attack on weakagreement.
	- (non)injectiveagreement_seaf_ue_kseaf_noAsyKeyRev_noSupiRev_noSqnRev_noChanRev are violated because of attack on weakagreement.

  = SUPI:
	- injective agreement fails trivially (supi is constant)
	- non-injective agreement is the same as weak agreement.

  = SNname:

	- non-injective agreement is the same as weak agreement.

	- weakagreement_seaf_ue_noAsyKeyRev_noSupiRev_noSqnRev_noChanRev is violated.
	- weakagreement_seaf_ue_noKeyRev_noChanRev is satisfied because injective agreement is satisfied.

  => minimal assumption is not(K) AND channel secure (AND binding channel)


Agreement of SEAF with UE after KC:

  -> Same as before KC.


## First FIX described in Section 5.3.3 (adding SNname in MAC): 5G_AKA_fix.spthy
        - injectiveagreement_ue_seaf_kseaf_noKeyRev_noChanRev is violated by definition (SEAF cannot make any running claim containing SUPI before UE commits)
        - anonymous_injectiveagreement_ue_seaf_kseaf_noKeyRev_noChanRev (where we do not require SEAF to know its partner's identity) holds: autoproven with the oracle 5G_AKA_fix.oracle

## Second FIX described in Section 5.3.3 (unidirectional key-confirmation)
